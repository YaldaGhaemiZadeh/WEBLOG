it is my first try to make a website using react and tailwind, and publishing it to github
i attached figma design to the project folder

problems that i'm trying to solve :
-navbar width
-carousel : 1.when you slide, cards edges are outside of the container 2.styling detailes like the 
position of previous and next buttons and dots under cards
-the logo on the navbar...
-non-respawnsive 
-cleaning codes + proper naming

i will fix the issues, i just need to spend more time and learn more about react, tailwind and swiper
